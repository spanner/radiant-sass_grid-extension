#Sass Grid#

This is a very simple extension that sassifies the [960 grid system](http://960.gs/) and makes its styles available both as classes and as sass mixins. Right now it's experimental but it ought to work.

##Usage##

Put this at the top of a sass file:

	@import 960.sass

And then you can get grid styles in various ways. These have the same effect:

In html:

	<div id="pagecontent" class="grid_6 prefix_1">...</div>

In sass:

	#pagecontent
	  +grid(6)
	  +prefix(1)
	
Depending on which features of the system you use, you may also want your layout to bring in `/stylesheets/ie960.css`.

##Requirements##

Nothing is actually required. If you're running multisited and you want css coming from the database rather than the filesystem, this is compatible with both the `sns_sass_filter` and `sass_filter` extensions but you probably need to change the import line to:

	@import /stylesheets/sass/960.sass

##Installation##

	git submodule add git://github.com/spanner/radiant-sass_grid-extension.git vendor/extensions/960gs
	rake radiant:extensions:sass_grid:update 

##Compatibility##

This should just work with radiant 0.9, but it requires a more recent version of sass than is included with radiant 0.8.1. You can make it work with a bit of careful tinkering:

	# sudo gem install haml
	# cd /path/to/radiant/gem
	# rm -rf vendor/plugins/haml
	# haml --rails .
	
This will replace the vendored haml with a stub that uses the gem instead and will always be up to date. There is no guarantee that this will not break something in radiant.
